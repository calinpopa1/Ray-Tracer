Ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.
This program uses raytracing to create realistic images.

To run the program clone the repo using and open the project in a text editor that has C++ support. Then build and run the code.

This is what one of the generated images looks like.
